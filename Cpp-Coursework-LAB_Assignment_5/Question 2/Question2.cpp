/*
a. Valid. Both pointers have the same type and can be assigned to each other.
b. Invalid. The types of num and ptr1 are different, and they cannot be assigned to each other without a type conversion.
c. Invalid. The types of ptr1 and ptr3 are different, and they cannot be assigned to each other without a type conversion.
d. Invalid. ptr2 is a pointer to int, and ptr3 is a pointer to double. They cannot be dereferenced and assigned to each other without a type conversion.
e. Valid. Both pointers have the same type, and they can be dereferenced and assigned to each other.
f. Valid. *ptr2 is an int, which can be assigned to num.
g. Invalid. &ptr2 is the address of a pointer, which has a different type than ptr1. They cannot be assigned to each other without a type conversion.
h. Valid. &num is the address of an int, which can be assigned to ptr1.
i. Invalid. &ptr1 is the address of a pointer, which has a different type than num. They cannot be assigned to each other without a type conversion.
