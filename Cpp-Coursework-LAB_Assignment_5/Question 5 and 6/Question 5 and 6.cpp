/*
Dynamic memory allocation is a feature in C++ that allows programmers to allocate memory during runtime instead of compile-time.
In other words, instead of specifying the amount of memory needed for a variable or data structure at the time of writing the code, memory is allocated when the program is executed.

Dynamic memory allocation is important to me as a C++ programmer because it allows me to create data structures that can change in size or shape during program execution.
This makes C++ programs more flexible and dynamic. This makes C++ programs more flexible and dynamic.
