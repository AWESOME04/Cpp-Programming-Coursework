LAB 4

1. Write a program that uses a two-dimensional array to store the highest and
lowest temperatures for each month of the year. The program should output the
average high, average low, and the highest and lowest temperatures for the
year. Your program must consist of the following functions:

a. Function getData: This function reads and stores data in the twodimensional array.

b. Function averageHigh: This function calculates and returns the average high
temperature for the year.

c. Function averageLow: This function calculates and returns the average low
temperature for the year.

d. Function indexHighTemp: This function returns the index of the highest
high temperature in the array.

e. Function indexLowTemp: This function returns the index of the lowest low
temperature in the array. (These functions must all have the appropriate
parameters.)

2. Write a program that reads a student name followed by five test scores. The
program should output the student name, the five test scores, and the average
test score. Output the average test score with two decimal places. The data to be
read is stored in a file called test.txt. The output should be stored in a file called
testavg.out.2

For example:

Input File (contents of the file test.txt):
Kwamena Daniel 37.50 19 65.75 27 91.50
Output File (contents of the file testavg.out):
Student name: Kwamena Daniel
Test scores: 37.50 19 65.75 27 91.50
Average test score: 71.56

3. (Airplane Seating Assignment) Write a program that can be used to assign seats
for a commercial airplane. The airplane has 13 rows, with six seats in each row.
Rows 1 and 2 are first class, rows 3 through 7 are business class, and rows 8
through 13 are economy class. Your program must prompt the user to enter the
following information:

a. Ticket type (first class, business class, or economy class).

b. Desired seat.
